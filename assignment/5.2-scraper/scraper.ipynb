    "The quick way to get HTML data is by saving the HTML file to your computer manually. Also, a web page's HTML is known to change over time. Scraping code can break easily when web redesigns occur, which makes scraping brittle and not recommended for projects with longevity. So, to ease access and manage the traffic, we have scraped the TampereBNB website and extracted and stored data in the `data/accom` folder. Please, just use these HTML files provided to you and pretend like you saved them yourself. I recommend that you do and open the HTML files in your preferred text editor to inspect the HTML for the how the website structured information.\n",
